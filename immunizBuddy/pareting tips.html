                       <h2>Boost Your Child's Self-Esteem -</h2> 
                       <p class="mt-2">Kids start developing their sense of self as babies when they see themselves through their parents' eyes. <br>Your tone of voice, your body language, and your every expression are absorbed by your kids. <br> <br>
                        Your words and actions as a parent affect their developing self-esteem more than anything else. <br>

                        Praising accomplishments, however small, will make them feel proud; letting kids do things <br> independently will make them feel capable and strong. By contrast, belittling comments or comparing  <br>
                        a child unfavorably with another will make kids feel worthless. <br> <br>
                        
                        Avoid making loaded statements or using words as weapons. Comments like "What a stupid thing to do! <br> " or "You act more like a baby than your little brother!" cause damage just as physical blows do. <br>
                        
                        Choose your words carefully and be compassionate. Let your kids know that everyone makes mistakes <br> and that you still love them, even when you don't love their behavior.</p> 
                        
                        <h2>Catch Kids Being Good -</h2> 
                       <p class="pb-2">Have you ever stopped to think about how many times you react <br> negatively to your kids in a given day? You may find yourself criticizing <br>far more often than complimenting. How would you feel about a boss <br> who treated you with that much negative guidance, even if it was <br> well-intentioned?  <br> <br>

                        The more effective approach is to catch kids doing something right: <br> "You made your bed without being asked — that's terrific!" or "I was <br> watching you play with your sister and you were very patient." <br> These statements will do more to encourage good behavior over the long run <br> than repeated scoldings. <br> <br>
                        
                        Make a point of finding something to praise every day. Be generous with rewards — <br> your love, hugs, and compliments can work wonders and are often reward enough. <br> Soon you will find you are "growing" more of the behavior you would like to see.</p> 

                        <h2>Set Limits and Be Consistent With Your Discipline -</h2> 
                        <p class="mt-2">Kids start developing their sense of self as babies when they see themselves through their parents' eyes. <br>Your tone of voice, your body language, and your every expression are absorbed by your kids. <br> <br>

                            Avoid making loaded statements or using words as weapons. Comments like "What a stupid thing to do! <br> " or "You act more like a baby than your little brother!" cause damage just as physical blows do. <br>
